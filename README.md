## gatsby-starter-blog

I started to build this blog on top of a [Gatsby starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).
[Here](https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/) is what the original looked like, though I have made lots of changes.

## Running in development

To start development, run `gatsby develop`
